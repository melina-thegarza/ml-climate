To develop an AI-driven climate risk assessment for financial markets, we propose using machine learning to predict natural disasters like floods based on historical weather data, and evaluate their impact on housing prices.  We will leverage decision trees  to predict flood occurrence (e.g., flood/no flood), using features like precipitation, temperature, and historical flood records. For predicting the severity of floods, regression trees will be applied.  To assess the impact on housing markets, random forests and gradient boosting decision trees (like XGBoost or LightGBM) will be used to analyze how flood severity, location, and socio-economic factors influence housing values. Lastly, time-series forecasting and ensemble methods will enhance model accuracy.
